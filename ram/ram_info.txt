// 1. All Modern PC Motherboard have RAM Channels
//    Usually a DUAL channel will provide greater performance
//    than a using only 1 of the 2 channels. 

//    Improve performance by using both channels if you only have 
//    2 ram sticks. 
//    Consult manual for the correct locations for alternating
//    ram channels. 
//    Or use the general rule of thumb of staggering ram 1 one
//    slot of empty space if there are 4 slots and 2 sticks used.

//    Color coded slots are usually indiciative of an easy way
//    to make sure you are using both channels if both sticks
//    are using the SAME color. But this can vary by motherboard.
