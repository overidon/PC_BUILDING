// 1.   Fan Airflow flow in starting with the NON-Caged Side
//      The Air flows in toward the caged side 
//      Air PULLS from the NON_CAGED side and PUSHES that air
        past the CAGED SIDE.


// 2.   Core Concept for setting up fans for a CASE
// 2A.  Have all the intake fans on one general side
// 2B.  Have all exaust case fans on the opposite side 
        of the intakes

// 3.   PUSH vs PULL configuration for 
        CPU Cooler Air Cooler Heatsink Combos
        
// 3A.  PUSH config is having air from within the case
//      PUSH into the air cooler 
        (potentially air coming from RAM area - this is 
        dependant on the motherboard configuration).
        
// 3B.  PUSH config is optimal and if there is a second
        fan attached to the coolor it should be in PULL
        config to maintain airflow and not create
        static pressure. 

// 4.   ALL IN ONE / RADIATOR CPU COOLERS - 360 Sized ( 3 Fans of 120mm sized) approx
// 4A.  These units should generall be configured to be connected 
//      Where the Radiator of the unit and should have air in PUSH Config
//      The air should be moving away from the radiatior and 
//      out of the case.

// 4B.  If possible it is good to have the pump level or slightly 
//      above the radiator tubing in order to avoid extra
//      pump wear and tear. 

// 4.   ALL IN ONE / RADIATOR CPU COOLERS -  240  Sized ( 2 Fans of 120mm sized) approx
// 4A.  Basically you don't want the tubing from the CPU pump too high

// 4B.  The idea is to get the CPU / PUMP side slower than the tubing connecting to the radiator

//.     Also people are recommending that the radiator is connected to the FRONT of the case
//      and the tubes of the radiator are as high as possible.
